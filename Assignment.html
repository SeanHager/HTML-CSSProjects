      <h2><center>Starcraft IGN Review</center></h2>
      <p>All jacked up and good to go! Starcraft 1 Remastered remains a competitor in re-vamped RTS games!</p>

            StarCraft remains a titan of the genre for a reason. Though its interface lacks some contemporary conveniences, Blizzard has still, to this day, failed to outdo itself in terms of the elegant balance between three highly asymmetrical factions that was achieved in Brood War. Whether you want to revisit the glory days or see a piece of gaming history for the first time, StarCraft Remastered is a trip well worth taking.
